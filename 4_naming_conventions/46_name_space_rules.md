## 4.6 Name Space Rules

ISO C defines several name spaces (see ISO/IEC 9899:1994 6.1.2.3). The same
name could be used in a separate name space for a completely different item.

Name spaces are defined as:

* label names
* tags of structures, unions and enumerators
* Members of structures or unions
* All other identifiers.

**********
**Note:** Name space and scope are not synonymous. Name space rules do not
apply to scope. Scope is described in "Scoping Rules".
**********

### 4.6.1 Names shall be used consistently within the same type.

For example, structure tags may only be reused as structure types, and union
tags may be reused only for union types.

```c
typedef struct MyStruct {
  UINT32  One;
  UINT32  Two;
  UINT32  Three;
} MY_STRUCT;
```

Because of the similarity of `MyStruct` to `MY_STRUCT`, they may only be used
to refer to the same structure type.

### 4.6.2 No identifier in one name space may be reused as an identifier in another name space

Exceptions are structure member and union member names.

```c
typedef struct StructOne {
  INT32             One;
  INT16             Two;
  struct StructOne  *MySelf;
} STRUCT_ONE;

typedef struct StructTwo {
  INT16             One;
  INT8              *Two;
  struct StructTwo  *MySelf;
} STRUCT_TWO;

typedef struct {
  STRUCT_ONE  *StructOne;     // NOT ALLOWED
  STRUCT_TWO  *StructTwoPtr;  // ALLOWED, it is unique
} BAD_STRUCT;
```

### 4.6.3 A typedef name shall be a unique identifier.

The name that appears at the end of a typedef (`STRUCT_ONE` and `STRUCT_TWO` in
the example in Section 4.6.2) is known as a _typedef name_. Because of ambiguity
in the C specifications, and to avoid confusion, and once a typedef name is used
in a structure declaration, it may not be declared elsewhere

**********
**Note:** Including the declaration in a header file that is then included in a
number of files is not a violation of this rule.
**********

### 4.6.4 A tag name shall be unique.

The name after the `struct` in structure definitions (`StructOne` and
`StructTwo` in the example in 4.6.2) is known as a _structure tag_ or simply a
_tag_. To avoid confusion, once a tag is used for declaring a structure it
shall not be declared elsewhere.

**********
**Note:** Including a header file that contains a structure definition is not a
violation of this rule.
**********

### 4.6.5 Prefix module-scope identifiers for cleaner namespaces.

The use of prefixes is not an absolute requirement, but has been shown as a
successful method of avoiding namespace pollution and makes it easier to meet
other naming requirements. A useful prefix is the module's name. For example,
the UEFI Shell uses the prefix "Shell" for its identifiers.

```
SHELL_FREE_NON_NULL (Buffer);
ShellCommandLibConstructor (ImageHandle, SystemTable);
```
